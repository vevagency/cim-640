# CIM640 - Midterm - Tip Tap Toe

##### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
The motivation of this project is to provide customized tic-tac-toe games
to the dance schools around Miami.

By placing the logo of the dance studio on the game, a one-time fee can be collected. The dance studio's can place the link on their website, and offer it to their students and parents to play and share with pride of their dance academy.

The program can be further customized beyond the logo by altering the images of Player 1 and Player 2 upon request. Potentially, dance school's can sell the tic-tac-toe game to their own student by offering to put the student's faces as Player 1 and Player 2 as a gift at the end of the year recital from parents.

There are many possibilities, however, the overall motivation is to contribute to dance school pride by the students and faculty, as well as an interactive game that the dance company can put on their website as added value to drive greater web traffic.
