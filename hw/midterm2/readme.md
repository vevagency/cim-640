# CIM640 - Midterm - Tip Tap Toe

### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
The focus of this project is to provide customized tic-tac-toe games
to the dance schools around Miami.

By placing the logo of the dance studio in the game, a one-time fee can be collected. The dance studio's can place the link on their website, and the added value of an interactive game on the dance company's website can help drive an increase in website traffic.

This interface can be further customized beyond the logo by altering the images of Player 1 and Player 2 upon request. Potentially, dance school's can sell the tic-tac-toe game to their own student by offering to put the student's faces as Player 1 and Player 2 as a gift at the end of the year recital from parents.

The overall motivation is for the dance school to foster pride among students, parents, and faculty, and to share the game with friends and family, which will drive more recognition to the dance studio, students, and parents involved in dance.
