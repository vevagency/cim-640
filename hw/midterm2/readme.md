# CIM640 - Midterm - Tip Tap Toe

### Motivation
The focus of this project is to provide customized tic-tac-toe games
to the dance schools around Miami.

By placing the logo of the dance studio in the game, a one-time fee can be collected, and includes the added value of setting up the link to the game in the dance company's website, as an interactive game can increase website traffic.

This interface can be further customized beyond the dance school's logo by altering the images of Player 1 and Player 2 upon request. This is based on the idea that dance schools sell spots to parents in the end of year dance recital playbook. The dance school can sell a customized tic-tac-toe game to the parents by offering the chance to place their child's dance photo as Player 1, and a friend as Player 2, as a unique end of the year gift from parents to the students. The parents and students can additionally share their special celebratory tic-tac-toe game with family and friends, sharing the link on social media and also garnering further exposure for the dance school.

The overall motivation is for the dance school to foster pride among students, parents, and faculty, and to share the game with friends and family, while also driving more website traffic for the dance company, which will together garner more recognition to all involved in the dance studio.
