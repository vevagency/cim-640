Healthy plant app

This app is meant to identify your plant and tell you its current state of health!

The problem is not knowing how much water or sunlight the plant has or needs, more over if it has excess or less nourishment than required.

The app prompts you to take a photo of the plant.

It will then show you a related photo of the same plant identified, with the name of the plant, species, and requirements of sunlight, water, plant food and frequency for nourishment.

You can then assess the plant by pressing a button that will read the electromagnetic waves of the plant to give results of the current amount of water, sunlight, and plant food levels.
