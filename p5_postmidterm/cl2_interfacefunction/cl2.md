### CL2 Customizing functions

* Created buttons using constructor, functions, and checks

##### Functions

* Create function, and console log to check function
* Want to make sure functions are as small and precise as possible
* Variables in a function only exist within a function
* Best way to design, it's self contained, not pulling from other  
  parts in the code
* Are not unique, have characteristics, but not tied to anything,
  have some variables, but not committed to other parts in code  

##### Objects
* Objects are going to have specific characteristics to each one

##### Constructor
* Characteristics for your object, i.e. x location, y location, size, color
* Going to include the limited parameters needed for the character to exist
* Reference variables inside the object always referred to as "this.x"
* Make constructor first, then can add more logic

##### Class
* Anything in the class should affect anything outside of the    
  class

##### Check
* Really only need mouse X and mouse Y, i.e. check(mX,mY);
