### Motivation
The focus of this project is to provide customized tic-tac-toe games
to the dance schools around Miami.

By placing the logo of the dance studio in the game, a one-time fee can be collected, and may include the option of setting up the game link in the dance company's website, as an interactive game can increase website traffic.

The overall motivation is for the dance school to foster pride among students, parents, and faculty, and to share the game with friends and family, while also driving more website traffic for the dance company, which will together garner more recognition to all involved in the dance studio.

This interface can be further customized beyond the dance school's logo by altering the images of Player 1 and Player 2 upon request. This is based on the idea that dance schools sell advertising spots to parents in the end of year dance recital playbook. The dance school can additionally sell this customized tic-tac-toe game to the parents by offering the chance to place their child's dance photo as Player 1, and a friend as Player 2, as a unique end of the year gift for the students. Moreover, the parents and students can share their special celebratory tic-tac-toe game with family and friends on social media, which garners further exposure for the dance school. This option would be coordinated between the the "Tip Tap Toe" programmers and the dance school in order to provide to the parents.
